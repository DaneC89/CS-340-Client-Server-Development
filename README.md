    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    I try to make sure that what I am writing is able to simply be adjusted for other programs.
    Using object oriented programming is a great way to ensure that the code can be used in a variety
    of different programs. A great example of this is the CRUD file that was created for this class.
    By using key words like readAll, it is very easy to implement this into other programs. 
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    The first thing is to clearly understand what is being asked of me. Understanding the assignment 
    helps to ensure that the task is being handled properly. Breaking up the various requirements into 
    sections makes it a lot easier to handle the workload. My person has assignment was not too much different 
    from other assignments have had in the past. Breaking the work up in the sections helps to mitigate
    issues. 
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
    The computer scientists generally takes real world problems and solves them using computer software.
    The overall goal of this project was to make a usable database for the employees of Grazioso Salvare. This 
    can help in a variety of ways. Making databases easier to navigate would help with streamlining the efficiency
    of the task that needs to be completed. With less time used to do a manual search, our new program
    can help finding and solving problems much faster. With this particular scenario this could mean that
    more life saving animals are found and saved. Inturn, this will help save lives.
